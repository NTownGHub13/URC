# Contributing

<!-- todo: add commands -->

This is a simple guide for contributing to Pitt's University Rover Challenge. If you have any questions, please either contact Nick or Alex.

1. The main branch is protected, you can not directly push commits to this branch. The main branch is considered the most recent production-ready code.
2. To perform work, please create a new branch to push commits into.
3. When you have finished and tested your code, make a pull request. You need one approval to merge any commits into the main branch.
4. After the merge, the branch must be deleted or archived.

## Other tips

1. Keep commit descriptions accurate and clear. Do not put descriptions like '.' or 'u'.
2. If you encounter problems, ask!
